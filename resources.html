                    Why 3R? It’s easy: although we cannot completely erase all the plastics at this moment due to our current technology, we can limit the amount of plastic we manufacture and use. It’s like having a diet: if you wanna lose some weight, eat less! If you wanna save our oceans, use less plastics, so they are less likely to end up in our oceans. Why reuse? Same thing-- if we already practice limiting the amount of plastic products manufactured, why don’t we reuse them? As always, recycle them so they don’t end up killing wildlife.

                    Why manufacture plastics or other non-recyclable products when we can use sustainable products? Here’s a simple way to ask fast: when you go to your local Chinese fast food restaurants for some chow meins, don’t take their bamboo chopsticks or plastic forks. Instead, you can grab some metal chopsticks and forks. Similarly,  why spend a dollar on a water bottle when you can purchase a reusable bottle? Not only are you drinking water from your own house, you can also wash them, dry them, and be a good vsco person.

                    It’s obvious: you are breaking the law and ruining the scenery. Be a law abiding citizen smh.

                    Not only you can help your community clean up local water, it is also an amazing opportunity to take a selfie next to the sunsetting beach and use the hashtag #savetheturtles. It is a typical win-win situation. You are helping the ocean, and you are also gaining followers on Instagram from your amazing photography skills. Modern problems require modern solutions; be a smart kid and clean your local beach.
