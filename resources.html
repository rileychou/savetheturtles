                        Why 3R? It’s easy: although we cannot completely erase all the plastics at this moment due to
                        our current technology, we can limit the amount of plastic we manufacture and use. It’s like
                        having a diet: if you wanna lose some weight, eat less! If you wanna save our oceans, use less
                        plastics, so they are less likely to end up in our oceans. Why reuse? Same thing-- if we already
                        practice limiting the amount of plastic products manufactured, why don’t we reuse them? As
                        always, recycle them so they don’t end up killing wildlife.

                    <p>
                        Why manufacture plastics or other non-recyclable products when we can use sustainable products?
                        Here’s a simple way to ask fast: when you go to your local Chinese fast food restaurants for
                        some chow meins, don’t take their bamboo chopsticks or plastic forks. Instead, you can grab some
                        metal chopsticks and forks. Similarly, why spend a dollar on a water bottle when you can
                        purchase a reusable bottle? Not only are you drinking water from your own house, you can also
                        wash them, dry them, and be a good vsco person.

                        Not only you can help your community clean up local water, it is also an amazing opportunity to
                        take a selfie next to the sunsetting beach and use the hashtag #savetheturtles. It is a typical
                        win-win situation. You are helping the ocean, and you are also gaining followers on Instagram
                        from your amazing photography skills. Modern problems require modern solutions; be a smart kid
                        and clean your local beach.

                <h1>4Ocean</h1>
                <p>4Ocean is a business that is here to clean the ocean and coastlines while working to stop the inflow of plastic by changing consumption habits. They were born on a plastic-covered beach in Bali, Indonesia. Upom visiting Bali for the surf trip of their life time, the founders of 4Ocean found a beach that was completely covered in plastic, with trash-filled waves delivering more garbage with each break. They were surprised at what they saw, yet were told that the beaches had been cleaned just hours earlier. The trash they were wading through had only just washed ashore. Their eyes were immediately opened to the magnitude of the ocean plastic crisis, and they vowed on the spot to try to do something about it.</p>
