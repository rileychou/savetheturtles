                Our ocean has a problem: pollution. All the troubles we are facing right now can be narrowed down into a single word: pollution. That’s it. According to Surfertoday, a website that focuses on on-water activities and such, listed the top ten ocean issues that we currently face. Here are some of the interesting finds: trash, overexploitation, oil drilling, destruction of habitats, and ocean acidification. Now if we rewire our logic and work on these details a little bit, we can see oil drilling and trash are pollutants that cause ocean acidification and the destruction of habitats. Tons of plastic wastes are dumped into oceans annually, and it is proven that these wastes cause more than the ones we listed above. Plastic and pollutants trap ocean wildlife, and inevitably choke them to death. The situation seems pretty grim right now, but not all hope is lost. Here’s PoG, we are looking for ways to eliminate plastic in the ocean.

                But wait! Here’s something more than that: permafrost melt. The Siberian arctic circle is experiencing a pretty uncommon Summer this year. To verbally describe how weird this Summer is, imagine how the arctic circle looks like. It’s white, it’s snowy, it’s bright, and you can feel the cold just by looking at pictures you found on Google. To take it into perspective, the Siberian arctic circle just hit 38 degrees Celsius recently. That is 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit. If we do not stop the permafrost melting in a speedy fashion, sea levels will rise, O2 levels will increase and cause temperature to warm up quicker, resulting in a hotter Summer. Therefore, we cannot only focus on cleaning ocean pollutants, we also need to look into the permafrost melting crisis.

                    <p>
                        Riley worked on the front end and building the AI chatbot for this project. He is passionate about technology, the ocean, and sports. Besides coding, Riley's hobbies include scuba diving, snowboarding, swimming, biking, ice skating, and gaming. Riley is a huge fan of the San Jose Sharks and the Oakland A's, and he wishes to play for them, but he just seems to be better at coding. Fun fact: Riley has never fallen off the bleachers when taking group photos because he is short and is always at the bottom.

                    <p>
                        Damian is a style designer who is a noob for coding, but pro for hardware hacks. He designed PP the mascot. He always experiences technical difficulties, which motivates him to create better technology :P Although he creates 3D models using Autodesk Inventor and Fusion360, he does not have a 3D printer himself. He has a bunch of crazy ideas, but he usually does not have the experience or tools to make the ideas real. Fun fact: he is a pro at Krunker.io and his ign is D_237. Go send trades and join sodm.
